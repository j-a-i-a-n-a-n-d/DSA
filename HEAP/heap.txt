a complete binary tree 
cbt ==> ya toh 0 bacche ya toh 2 bacche 
each and every level fully filled 
except the last level
nodes are always added from the left



complete binary tree vs the perfect binary tree

=> complete binary tree me last level chodke baaki sab m 0 ya 2bacche
=> perfect binary tree ya toh 2 bacche ya toh 0 hr level me 

                  x
                 / \
                x   x
               / \ / \
              x  xx   x
              perfect binary tree 


insetion in a complete binary tree 

consider an array of 6 elements we will start our indexing from i+1
hence the elements in the array will be 5

some important locations(indices where we will find elements )

Node => ith index
Left Child => 2*i index 
Right Child => (2*i + 1)index
parent will be found on => (i/2)index
